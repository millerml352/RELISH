# Things I need to figure out:
# 1. Why are we comparing data in the table to the assessor website when we just got the data from the assessor?
#    1a. Is it simply because there was a delay in receiving data from the assessor and when that data is to be
#        put into mailing materials so we want to ensure it is as up to date as possible?
#        - if so then this would need some kind of web scraping mechanism to check for accuracy at processing time
#        - otherwise this should be able to eventually compare old group data to newly received data just fine
#        - even if it can't process all of the county, a decent percentage of parcels have not changed hands and
#          could be bypassed
# 2. How to get old and new information into separate columns?
# 3. I want it to be both automated and have human eye visually apparent checks - like highlight row green if old
#    and new names match
